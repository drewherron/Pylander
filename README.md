This program will force your files to fight each other until there is only one left.

I suggest never running this. Do you think this program cares about your helpless, mortal files? Don't use it at all, my friend. Don't lose your head.

If you do run it: don't have any files you want to keep in the working directory or any subdirectories.

An easy way to make test files with bash: `touch {1..10}.txt`
